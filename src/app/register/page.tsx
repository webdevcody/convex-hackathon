      <p>
        Judging will be subjective. There is no formal checklist of things that
        will make your submission better than others. The more polished and
        feature rich your application is, the better I may rank it. If you
        submit an application that has zero styling or looks buggy, it will
        probably rank bad compared to other applications that look like a decent
        amount of effort went into the submission.

      <h2 className="mt-12 text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">
        8. Project Requirements
      </h2>
      <p>
        Entrants must create a functioning web application utilizing Convex.
        Your application MUST at least use Convex&apos;s queries, mutations, and
        database. Failure to use the specified features of Convex will result in
        a disqualification. Convex has other features (such as file storage)
        which are not required for this hackathon submission, but might make
        your submissions look better. You can use any programming languages or
        framework you want as long as it integrates with Convex, and
        authentication / authorization is optional, but might be useful when
        trying to win in the collaborative category.

        17. General Conditions
      </h2>

      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6">
        <li className="mb-4">
          Sponsor and Administrator reserve the right, in their sole discretion,
          to cancel, suspend and/or modify the Hackathon, or any part of it, in
          the event of a technical failure, fraud, or any other factor or event
          that was not anticipated or is not within their control.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-4">
          Sponsor and Administrator reserve the right in their sole discretion
          to disqualify any individual or Entrant if it finds to be actually or
          presenting the appearance of tampering with the entry process or the
          operation of the Hackathon or to be acting in violation of these
          Official Rules or in a manner that is inappropriate, unsportsmanlike,
          not in the best interests of this Hackathon, or a violation of any
          applicable law or regulation.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-4">
          Any attempt by any person to undermine the proper conduct of the
          Hackathon may be a violation of criminal and civil law. Should the
          Sponsor or Administrator suspect that such an attempt has been made or
          is threatened, they reserve the right to take appropriate action
          including but not limited to requiring an Entrant to cooperate with an
          investigation and referral to criminal and civil law enforcement
          authorities.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-4">
          If there is any discrepancy or inconsistency between the terms and
          conditions of the Official Rules and disclosures or other statements
          contained in any Hackathon materials, including but not limited to the
          Hackathon Submission form, Hackathon Website, or advertising, the
          terms and conditions of the Official Rules shall prevail.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-4">
          The terms and conditions of the Official Rules are subject to change
          at any time, including the rights or obligations of the Entrant, the
          Sponsor, and Administrator. The Sponsor and Administrator will post
          the terms and conditions of the amended Official Rules on the
          Hackathon Website. To the fullest extent permitted by law, any
          amendment will become effective at the time specified in the posting
          of the amended Official Rules or, if no time is specified, the time of
          posting.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-4">
          If at any time before the deadline, an Entrant or prospective Entrant
          believes that any term in the Official Rules is or may be ambiguous,
          they must submit a written request for clarification.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-4">
          The Sponsor or Administrator‚Äôs failure to enforce any term of these
          Official Rules shall not constitute a waiver of that provision. Should
          any provision of these Official Rules be or become illegal or
          unenforceable in any jurisdiction whose laws or regulations may apply
          to an Entrant, such illegality or unenforceability shall leave the
          remainder of these Official Rules, including the Rule affected, to the
          fullest extent permitted by law, unaffected and valid. The illegal or
          unenforceable provision shall be replaced by a valid and enforceable
          provision that comes closest and best reflects the sponsor‚Äôs intention
          in a legal and enforceable manner with respect to the invalid or
          unenforceable provision.

          Hackathon, including but not limited to copyrighted material,
